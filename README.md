  <p>Recently Added Media Discord Notifier for Plex.</p>
</div>

# Recently Added

A Python application that monitors your Plex server for recently added media and sends summary notifications to Discord via webhooks. An unobtrusive way to alert users of recently added content.

## Features

- Monitors multiple Plex libraries (Movies, TV Shows, Kids content, Anime, 4K, etc.)
- Configurable lookback period for media additions
- Discord webhook notifications with rich embeds
- Support for different media types and quality categories
- Multi-platform Docker support (amd64, arm64, arm/v7)

## Prerequisites

- Plex Media Server
- Discord webhook URL
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Configuration

Create a `config.yml` file in the same directory as `main.py` with the following structure:

```yaml
pplex:
    url: "http://plex:32400"
    token: "{plex_token}"
    # These library names must exactly match the library names in Plex.
    libraries:
        movies: Movies
        shows: TV
        kids_movies: Movies - Kids
        kids_shows: TV - Kids
        anime_movies: Movies - Anime
        anime_shows: TV - Anime
        uhd_movies: Movies - 4K
        uhd_shows: TV - 4K
        mux_movies: Movies - Remux
        mux_shows: TV - Remux
